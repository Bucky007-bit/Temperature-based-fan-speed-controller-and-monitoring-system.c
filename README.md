WORKING:
1.ESP32 DevKit V1 : Acts as the central controller and communication hub. 
  Function: Reads the temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor. Based on the temperature, it calculates the appropriate fan speed and generates a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to 
  control the fan speed via the TIP120 transistor.  Sends real-time data (temperature and fan speed) to the Blynk IoT platform for remote monitoring. Receives commands from the Blynk app 
  for user control or automation.
2.DS18B20 Temperature Sensor : Measures the ambient temperature.
  Function: The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates with the ESP32 via the OneWire protocol. It provides temperature data in Celsius or Fahrenheit with a resolution 
  ranging from 9-bit to 12-bit.The waterproof version allows it to be used in both wet and dry environments. The sensor provides highly accurate temperature readings (±0.5°C accuracyfrom 
  -10°C to +85°C) and feeds this data to the ESP32 for processing
3. TIP120 NPN Darlington Transistor : Acts as a switch and amplifier to control the fan's power and speed.
  Function: The TIP120 is a Darlington transistor, which means it consists of two transistors connected to amplify the current. It is used to drive higher current loads (like a fan) 
  using low-power control signals from the ESP32.When the ESP32 sends a PWM signal to the base of the TIP120 transistor, it allows current to flow between the collector (connected to the 
  fan) and emitter (connected to ground).By adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the ESP32 can control the speed of the fan proportionally.
4.12v DC Fan :  The speed of the fan is controlled by the PWM signal generated by the ESP32 and amplified through the TIP120 transistor. As the temperature rises, the fan speed 
  increases, and as the temperature drops, the fan speed decreases. The fan runs on an external power supply (e.g., 12V) to ensure it has enough power to operate at different speeds.
5.Diode (1N4007):  Protects the circuit from back EMF (Electromotive Force) generated by the fan. When a fan (or any motor) turns off, it can generate a reverse voltage spike (back EMF) 
  that could damage other components in the circuit. The 1N4007 diode is placed across the fan terminals (cathode to the positive terminal and anode to the negative terminal) to absorb 
  this spike and protect the ESP32 and TIP120 from damage.
6. Blynk IoT Platform : Provides a user interface for remote monitoring and control. The ESP32 sends temperature and fan speed data to the Blynk server, which is displayed on the Blynk 
  app through widgets like gauges, graphs, or labels. Remote Control: You can monitor the system remotely from your smartphone and set parameters or even manually control the fan speed, 
  depending on how the app is configured . You can set thresholds for temperature values in the Blynk app to receive alerts or notifications if the temperature exceeds a certain level. 
  The ESP32 connects to the internet via your Wi-Fi router or mobile hotspot and communicates with the Blynk cloud server. This enables you to remotely monitor and control the system 
  from anywhere through the Blynk mobile app.
7. External Power Supply ( 12V Adapter): Powers the fan. Function:Since the fan likely requires more power than the ESP32 can provide directly, it is powered by an external source, such 
  as a 12V DC adapter. The ESP32 controls the fan's speed using the TIP120 transistor, while the external power supply ensures the fan has sufficient current to operate.The ESP32 is 
  powered from 7805 IC . 7805 IC step down the 12v dc to 5 v dc which is sufficient for ESP32
